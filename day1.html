<h1>My family.</h1>
<p>
I live in a large family. There are eight members in it. They are my father, my mother, my grand-father, my grand-mother, myself, my brother and my two sisters.

The member of my family:

The name of my father is Shri Narottam Nayak. He is a farmer. He works in the field. My mother lives inside the house. She cooks food for us. She looks after the household. The names of my two sisters are Jhilli and Milli. They help my mother in her household work. My brother is younger than I. His name is Shri Nabe Kishore Nayak. He reads in Class. VII in our Village M. E. School. I am a student of Class X and I read in the M. S. Academy, Tirtol.
The house where I live with my family:

There are a lot of rooms in my house. These are two sleeping-rooms, one store-room, one study, one drawing-room and a kitchen. Outside the rooms there is a cow-shed and a shed for the thrashing horse. There is a very spacious courtyard in my house area.

Financial condition:

My father earns about four thousand rupees a year from his field. We manage somehow with this small income. My mother is a very careful lady. She takes much care so that no unnecessary wastage is possible in our family. We get milk from our cows. From our garden we get fruits and vegetables.

Food and dress habits:

Generally, we eat cooked food like rice, dal, curry, fry, toast, roast, milk and tea. Our Tiffin include beaten rice, fried rice, wheat bread, cakes and milk-products.

Our clothing are no better than the common countryside clothing of Orissa. My father and grand-father wear cotton clothes. My mother and grand-mother wear cotton sarees. I put on a half pant and a shirt. My brother also puts on as I do. My sisters put on frocks and pants.

Dogs aren’t only animals, but also they are close to human being in life. I love dogs, and I want to take care of them every day. Therefore, when I was 13, I saved a little money, and decided to have a Poodle dog. being  common pets, they are ranked one of the most beautiful pets in the world.

My dog’s name is Cake, because he looks like a white cake, and I want to bitch him. He is quite small, and he has white and curly hair with beautiful eyes….it looks so cute. Everyday, I usually feed him, and take him to have a bath, and walk in the park every afternoon. My friends really love him so much, and they also want to have one. Feeding pet makes me busy, and enjoys life. When I feel stressed because of study or complaint of my parents, I usually talk to him, and he helps me solve the problems effectively.

For me, Cake isn’t a general dog, but also he is an important part of my life. And you, tell me about your dog!
